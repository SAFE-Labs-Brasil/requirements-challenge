#### Description

PMSE wishes to digitize its documents, mainly the medical records of its employees. This is for the following reasons:

1.	There is no more storage space for the amount of paper generated by the documentation;
2.	Need for transparency in access to information;
3.	Difficulty in searching for old information;

#### General Vision!

PMSE will start digitizing documents, so it needs an electronic document management system. Being a system for the Military Police, it needs to meet the three pillars of information security: Availability, confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation.!

Usually, each sector will have a manager who can assign roles to their employees. These can be:

- User: can search documents (Anyone in the organization is a user);
- 
- PMSE Employee: can search documents and include personal documents destined for HR, their direct superior and the medical sector;
- 
- Editor: Each sector has one or more editors responsible for entering old scanned documents into the system;
- 
- Manager: Responsible for assigning roles in your sector;
- 
- Administrator: Responsible for registering new managers.
- 
The system will be linked to the HR system, so assign the roles in the system.

Each document has a link to an employee; through its number plate. There must be a type for each record, the block where the document is, its date, and a way to load the document. After loading the document, the system must automatically extract the text from the document.

The document, when loaded, must display document verification information so that the editor or employee validates confirming that everything is correct with the loading of the document.

There must also be document access management done by the document block, which can include users, user groups, user sectors.
The system must have a section of audit registers so that it can follow the access to the documents and possible modifications.
It is also possible to search for documents to facilitate access to information.

A macro view of the system components can be seen in the figure below:

## Deliverables

The deliverable for this challenge is the documents,  inside a public GitHub repository of yours. You should provide us the URL for it.

Send us a report telling how was your experience with this challenge. Even if you can't finish, send the report because for us is more important to know your dedication on a project, thinking, and analytical skills, than looking only at your technical skills.

We will evaluate you based on how well the document is architected, your user story and desired requirements are described, your instructions and documentation on the README.MD and how well you defend your idea and decisions when presenting it to us.

If you have any questions, please send an email to your contact at SAFE Labs that we will reply as fast as we can :)
